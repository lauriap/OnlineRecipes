# User stories for Online Recipes

## User types

### 'User'

'User' is the only user type used for this application apart from the Admin. The User has access to the application via a webpage and is able to perform all tasks available on the website.

### 'Admin'

Admin has all the rights that a User has and on top of that has access to the source code and is thus able to carry out changes to the website and application.

Admin can also add and remove Users from the database


## User tasks

### Logging in to the site

As a User, I am able to log in to the website using my own nickname and password.

### Adding recipes to the database

As a User, I am able to add my own recipes to the database. Adding recipes includes being able to add ingredients, ingredient amounts, time required and meal type (starter, main course, dessert) related to the recipe.

### Listing recipes

As a User, I am able to list all recipes on the same webpage sorted alphabetically.

### Searching for recipes

As a User, I am able to search for recipes based on recipe name, meal type, time required and/or available ingredients.

### Viewing a recipe

As a User, I am able to view a recipe with all its related information, e.g. name, ingredients, instructions, time required etc.

### Changing information of a recipe in a database

As a User, I am able to change information, e.g. change the name or ingredients, related to a recipe the User has chosen from a list.


## Admin tasks

### Same usability as with User

As an Admin, I am able to carry out all the same tasks as a User is.

As an Admin, I am able to manually add and remove users to the system through the source code. All nicknames to be added are unique, no duplicates are allowed.
