# User stories for Online Recipes

## User types

### 'User'

'User' is the only user type used for this application apart from the Admin. The User has access to the application via a webpage and is able to perform all tasks available on the website (see below).

### 'Admin'

Admin has all the rights that a User has and on top of that has access to the source code and is thus able to carry out changes to the website and application.
