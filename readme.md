# Online Recipes
## The best way to keep track of your favourite recipes

An online recipe database that contains three tables and one join table: Account, Ingredient and Recipe as well as join table RecipeIngredient. The idea of the database and its interface is to provide the end-user with an easy way to search, add, modify and remove recipes according to their liking. The site also tracks the top contributors to the site and gives additional information about the most popular ingredients and the number of recipes availabe on the site.
