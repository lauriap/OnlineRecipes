# Online Recipes
## The best way to keep track of your favourite recipes

An online recipe database that contains three tables and one join table: Account, Ingredient and Recipe as well as join table RecipeIngredient. The idea of the database and its interface is to provide the end-user with an easy way to search, add, modify and remove recipes according to their liking. As an example of usage, the end-user can input the ingredients s/he has available and the site will return the dish recipes that are possible with the given ingredients. The database also tracks the creator of the recipes, which also makes it possible to track your or someone else's own recipes.
